# Environment Variables

This document explains the environment variables used in this project. These variables are defined in a `.env` file in the `server/` directory. You can use the `env.example` file as a template.

## Server Configuration

-   `PORT`: The port on which the server will run. Defaults to `3000`.
-   `BASE_URL`: The base URL of the frontend application. This is used for CORS, constructing magic links for email login, and other security configurations.
-   `NODE_ENV`: The node environment. Set to `production` for production environments. This affects things like cookie security and CORS settings.

## Square Credentials

-   `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Square Sandbox access token. This is required for processing payments.
-   `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`: Your Square Sandbox location ID. This is required for processing payments.

## Google OAuth Credentials

-   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google API client ID. This is used for authenticating with Google to send emails and for Google login.
-   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google API client secret.
-   `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`: The refresh token for the GMail API. This is obtained after the admin authenticates for the first time and is used to send emails. It is stored in `db.json` after the first authentication, but can be set here as a backup.

## Admin Configuration

-   `ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address of the administrator. This address receives notifications for new user registrations and critical server errors.

## WebAuthn Configuration

-   `RP_ID`: The Relying Party ID for WebAuthn (passkey) authentication. This should be the domain of your application (e.g., `example.com`).
-   `EXPECTED_ORIGIN`: The expected origin for WebAuthn authentication requests. This should be the full URL of your frontend application (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).

## Telegram Bot Configuration

-   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: The token for your Telegram bot. The bot is used to send notifications about new orders and order status updates.
-   `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of the Telegram channel where the bot will send messages.

## Shipment Tracking

-   `EASYPOST_API_KEY`: Your API key from [EasyPost](https://www.easypost.com/). This is required to enable automatic shipment tracking, which updates an order's status to "DELIVERED" when the package arrives. If this key is not provided, the shipment tracking feature will be disabled.

## Security and Session Management

-   `SESSION_SECRET`: A secret key for signing the session ID cookie.
-   `CSRF_SECRET`: A secret key for CSRF protection.
-   `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). If not provided, a new key will be generated on server startup. The key should be in PEM format.
-   `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`: The public key for verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). If not provided, a new key will be generated on server startup. The key should be in PEM format.
-   `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for encrypting the `db.json` file. Must be 32 bytes.
-   `ENCRYPT_CLIENT_JSON`: A boolean (`true` or `false`) that controls whether the `db.json` file is encrypted on disk.
